# Requirements

This file is the explicit capability and coverage contract for the project.

## Active

### R029 — Auto-worktree creation on milestone start
- Class: core-capability
- Status: active
- Description: When auto-mode starts a new milestone, it automatically creates a git worktree under `.gsd/worktrees/<MID>/` with branch `milestone/<MID>`, `chdir`s into it, and dispatches all units from within the worktree. The user never runs a git command.
- Why it matters: Worktree isolation gives each milestone its own `.gsd/` directory, eliminating the entire category of `.gsd/` merge conflicts that have caused ~15 separate bug fixes to date.
- Source: user
- Primary owning slice: M003/S01
- Supporting slices: none
- Validation: unmapped
- Notes: Must handle: fresh milestone (no worktree yet), resumed milestone (worktree already exists), milestone started from non-main branch. Must coexist with manual `/worktree` command.

### R030 — Auto-worktree teardown + squash-merge on milestone complete
- Class: core-capability
- Status: active
- Description: When a milestone completes, the milestone branch is squash-merged to main with a rich commit message, the worktree is removed, and `process.chdir` returns to the main project root. Main receives exactly one commit per milestone.
- Why it matters: Main stays clean and always represents completed, working milestones. One commit per milestone is individually revertable.
- Source: user
- Primary owning slice: M003/S03
- Supporting slices: M003/S01
- Validation: unmapped
- Notes: Must handle: dirty worktree at teardown time (auto-commit first), failed squash-merge (self-heal), remote push after merge (if auto_push enabled).

### R031 — `--no-ff` slice merges within milestone worktree
- Class: core-capability
- Status: active
- Description: Completed slices merge into the milestone branch via `--no-ff` merge instead of squash. This preserves the full per-task commit history on the milestone branch, with merge commits providing natural slice boundaries.
- Why it matters: The commit history is a diary of the agent's work. The LLM can read `git log` to understand what happened. Squashing slices destroys this granularity. `--no-ff` merge commits give clean slice boundaries while keeping all commits.
- Source: user
- Primary owning slice: M003/S02
- Supporting slices: M003/S01
- Validation: unmapped
- Notes: This is the default for worktree-isolated mode. The branch-per-slice legacy model retains its existing squash default.

### R032 — Rich milestone-level squash commit message
- Class: core-capability
- Status: active
- Description: When a milestone squash-merges to main, the commit message summarizes all slices and their key outcomes. Format: conventional commit subject + slice task list body + branch metadata.
- Why it matters: Main's git log should read like a changelog. Each milestone commit should tell the full story of what was built.
- Source: user
- Primary owning slice: M003/S03
- Supporting slices: none
- Validation: unmapped
- Notes: Similar to current rich commit message for slice merges, but at milestone level. Should list all slices with their titles and key outcomes.

### R033 — `git.isolation` preference
- Class: core-capability
- Status: validated
- Description: A `git.isolation` preference with values `"worktree"` (default for new projects) and `"branch"` (legacy model). New projects that have never run GSD default to worktree isolation. Existing projects with an established branch-per-slice history default to branch mode.
- Why it matters: Backwards compatibility — existing projects must not break. New projects get the better model by default.
- Source: user
- Primary owning slice: M003/S04
- Supporting slices: none
- Validation: Set-based validation in validatePreferences, shouldUseWorktreeIsolation resolver with three-tier resolution (explicit pref > legacy detection > default). 25 test assertions in preferences-git.test.ts and isolation-resolver.test.ts.
- Notes: Detection heuristic: if the project has existing `gsd/*` branches or milestone metadata with integration branch records, it's a legacy project → default to "branch". Otherwise → default to "worktree".

### R034 — `git.merge_to_main` preference
- Class: core-capability
- Status: validated
- Description: A `git.merge_to_main` preference with values `"milestone"` (default) and `"slice"`. In milestone mode, main only receives commits when milestones complete. In slice mode, each completed slice squash-merges to main immediately (current behavior).
- Why it matters: Senior engineers who want frequent integration can opt into slice-level merges. Vibe coders get the cleaner milestone-level default.
- Source: user
- Primary owning slice: M003/S04
- Supporting slices: M003/S03
- Validation: Set-based validation in validatePreferences, getMergeToMainMode helper, auto.ts merge routing gated behind preference. Tested in preferences-git.test.ts.
- Notes: `merge_to_main: "slice"` with `isolation: "worktree"` is valid — slices squash-merge to main from within the worktree, but the worktree still provides `.gsd/` isolation.

### R035 — Self-healing git repair on failure
- Class: core-capability
- Status: active
- Description: When git operations fail during auto-mode (merge conflict, checkout failure, corrupt state), the system automatically attempts repair: abort incomplete merges, reset working tree, retry the operation. Only truly unresolvable conflicts (two humans edited the same code) pause auto-mode with a clear explanation.
- Why it matters: The north star is "automagical — just runs." Git errors are the #1 cause of auto-mode halting. Self-healing eliminates most of those stops.
- Source: user
- Primary owning slice: M003/S05
- Supporting slices: M003/S01, M003/S02, M003/S03
- Validation: unmapped
- Notes: The worktree model eliminates most `.gsd/` conflicts structurally. Self-healing handles the remaining edge cases (code conflicts, remote divergence, corrupt index).

### R036 — `.gsd/` conflict resolution elimination
- Class: quality-attribute
- Status: active
- Description: The ~60 lines of `.gsd/` auto-resolve conflict code in `mergeSliceToMain` and the ~44 merge-related recovery paths in `auto.ts` are simplified or removed. Worktree isolation makes most of this code structurally unnecessary.
- Why it matters: Dead conflict resolution code is maintenance burden and a source of bugs. If the architecture eliminates the problem, the code that patches it should go.
- Source: inferred
- Primary owning slice: M003/S02
- Supporting slices: M003/S06
- Validation: unmapped
- Notes: Only remove code that is genuinely unnecessary in worktree mode. Keep the legacy branch-per-slice path intact for `git.isolation: "branch"` users.

### R037 — Zero git errors for vibe coders
- Class: primary-user-loop
- Status: active
- Description: Users with zero git knowledge should never see a git error message during auto-mode. All git operations are invisible. If something fails, the system self-heals or presents a non-technical explanation with a clear action ("Run `/gsd doctor` to fix this").
- Why it matters: Vibe coders are the primary market. Git errors are incomprehensible to them and destroy trust in the system.
- Source: user
- Primary owning slice: M003/S05
- Supporting slices: all M003 slices
- Validation: unmapped
- Notes: This is a quality bar, not a single feature. Every git-touching codepath must handle errors gracefully.

### R038 — Backwards compatibility with branch-per-slice model
- Class: continuity
- Status: active
- Description: Existing projects that use the branch-per-slice model continue working exactly as they do today. No migration required. The old codepaths remain functional when `git.isolation: "branch"` is active.
- Why it matters: Breaking existing users' workflows would destroy trust.
- Source: user
- Primary owning slice: M003/S04
- Supporting slices: none
- Validation: unmapped
- Notes: All existing git-service.ts tests must continue passing in branch mode.

### R039 — Manual `/worktree` coexistence with auto-worktrees
- Class: integration
- Status: active
- Description: The manual `/worktree` command for exploration coexists with auto-mode's milestone worktrees. Different naming conventions prevent conflicts: auto-worktrees use `milestone/M003` branches, manual worktrees use `worktree/<name>` branches.
- Why it matters: Manual worktrees are a valuable exploration tool. They shouldn't be broken by auto-mode's worktree usage.
- Source: user
- Primary owning slice: M003/S01
- Supporting slices: none
- Validation: unmapped
- Notes: Auto-worktrees are created under `.gsd/worktrees/` just like manual ones, but with milestone ID as the name. The naming convention prevents branch collisions.

### R040 — Doctor git health checks
- Class: operability
- Status: validated
- Description: `/gsd doctor` detects and optionally fixes git-related issues: orphaned auto-worktrees, stale milestone branches, corrupt merge state (MERGE_HEAD/SQUASH_MSG), tracked runtime files, missing gitignore patterns.
- Why it matters: When things do go wrong, users need a one-command fix. Doctor is the safety net.
- Source: inferred
- Primary owning slice: M003/S06
- Supporting slices: M003/S05
- Validation: 4 DoctorIssueCode values with detection and fix logic in checkGitHealth. 6 integration tests (17 assertions) in doctor-git.test.ts covering detect/fix/verify cycle for all codes plus safety guards.
- Notes: Doctor already handles planning artifact issues. This extends it to git health.

### R041 — Test coverage for worktree-isolated flow
- Class: quality-attribute
- Status: validated
- Description: Test suite covers: auto-worktree create/teardown, `--no-ff` slice merge within worktree, milestone squash to main, preference switching between isolation modes, self-heal scenarios, doctor git checks. All existing git tests continue passing.
- Why it matters: The git system is the most bug-prone part of GSD. Tests prevent regressions.
- Source: inferred
- Primary owning slice: M003/S07
- Supporting slices: all M003 slices
- Validation: worktree-e2e.test.ts — 20 assertions across 5 groups (lifecycle, preference gating, merge mode, self-heal, doctor). 291 unit tests pass with zero regressions.

## Validated

### R001 — Secret forecasting during milestone planning
- Class: core-capability
- Status: validated
- Description: When a milestone is planned, the LLM analyzes slices for external service dependencies and writes a secrets manifest listing every predicted API key with setup guidance.
- Why it matters: Without forecasting, auto-mode discovers missing keys mid-execution and blocks for hours waiting for user input.
- Source: user
- Primary owning slice: M001/S01
- Supporting slices: none
- Validation: plan-milestone.md Secret Forecasting section (line 62) instructs LLM to write manifest. Parser round-trip tested in parsers.test.ts.
- Notes: The plan-milestone prompt has forecasting instructions. The manifest format and parser are implemented and tested.

### R002 — Secrets manifest persisted in .gsd/
- Class: continuity
- Status: validated
- Description: The secrets manifest is a durable markdown file at `.gsd/milestones/M00x/M00x-SECRETS.md` that survives session boundaries and can be re-read by any future unit.
- Why it matters: Collection may happen in a different session than planning. The manifest must persist on disk.
- Source: user
- Primary owning slice: M001/S01
- Supporting slices: none
- Validation: parseSecretsManifest/formatSecretsManifest round-trip tested (parsers.test.ts), resolveMilestoneFile(base, mid, "SECRETS") resolves path.
- Notes: Parser/formatter implemented in files.ts. Template exists at templates/secrets-manifest.md.

### R003 — Step-by-step guidance per key
- Class: primary-user-loop
- Status: validated
- Description: Each secret in the manifest includes numbered steps for obtaining the key (navigate to dashboard → create project → generate key → copy), a dashboard URL, and a format hint.
- Why it matters: Users shouldn't have to figure out where to find each key. The guidance makes collection self-service.
- Source: user
- Primary owning slice: M001/S02
- Supporting slices: M001/S01
- Validation: collectOneSecret renders numbered dim-styled guidance steps with wrapping (collect-from-manifest.test.ts tests 6-8).
- Notes: Guidance quality is LLM-dependent and best-effort.

### R004 — Summary screen before collection
- Class: primary-user-loop
- Status: validated
- Description: Before collecting secrets one-by-one, show a read-only summary screen listing all needed keys with their status (pending / already set / skipped). Auto-skip keys that already exist in the environment.
- Why it matters: The user needs to see the full picture before entering keys. Already-set keys should not require re-entry.
- Source: user
- Primary owning slice: M001/S02
- Supporting slices: none
- Validation: showSecretsSummary() renders read-only ctx.ui.custom screen with status indicators via makeUI().progressItem() (collect-from-manifest.test.ts tests 4-5).
- Notes: Read-only with auto-skip — no interactive deselection.

### R005 — Existing key detection and silent skip
- Class: primary-user-loop
- Status: validated
- Description: Before prompting for a key, check `.env` and `process.env`. If the key already exists, mark it as "already set" in the summary and skip collection.
- Why it matters: Users shouldn't re-enter keys they've already configured. Prevents frustration and errors.
- Source: user
- Primary owning slice: M001/S02
- Supporting slices: none
- Validation: getManifestStatus cross-references checkExistingEnvKeys, categorizes env-present keys as existing (manifest-status.test.ts tests 4,7). collectSecretsFromManifest skips them (collect-from-manifest.test.ts tests 1-2).
- Notes: `checkExistingEnvKeys()` implemented in get-secrets-from-user.ts.

### R006 — Smart destination detection
- Class: integration
- Status: validated
- Description: Automatically detect whether secrets should go to .env, Vercel, or Convex based on project file presence (vercel.json → Vercel, convex/ dir → Convex, default → .env).
- Why it matters: Users shouldn't have to specify the destination manually. The system should do the right thing.
- Source: user
- Primary owning slice: M001/S02
- Supporting slices: none
- Validation: collectSecretsFromManifest calls detectDestination() for destination inference. applySecrets() routes to dotenv/vercel/convex accordingly.
- Notes: `detectDestination()` implemented in get-secrets-from-user.ts.

### R007 — Auto-mode collection at entry point
- Class: core-capability
- Status: validated
- Description: When the user runs `/gsd auto`, check for a secrets manifest with pending keys. If found, collect them before dispatching the first slice. Collection happens once at the entry point, not as a dispatch unit.
- Why it matters: This is the primary integration point — auto-mode must not start execution with uncollected secrets.
- Source: user
- Primary owning slice: M001/S03
- Supporting slices: M001/S01, M001/S02
- Validation: startAuto() secrets gate at auto.ts:479. auto-secrets-gate.test.ts — 3/3 pass covering null manifest, pending keys, and no-pending-keys paths.
- Notes: Collection at entry point (startAuto), not as a separate unit type in dispatchNextUnit. D001 satisfied.

### R008 — Guided /gsd wizard integration
- Class: core-capability
- Status: validated
- Description: After milestone planning in the guided `/gsd` flow, trigger secret collection if a manifest exists with pending keys.
- Why it matters: Users who plan via the wizard should also get prompted for secrets before auto-mode begins.
- Source: user
- Primary owning slice: M001/S03
- Supporting slices: M001/S01, M001/S02
- Validation: guided-flow.ts calls startAuto() directly (lines 52, 486, 647, 794) — all guided flow paths that start auto-mode inherit the secrets gate.
- Notes: The guided flow dispatches to startAuto after planning. Collection is inherited via the gate.

### R009 — Planning prompts instruct LLM to forecast secrets
- Class: integration
- Status: validated
- Description: The plan-milestone prompt template includes instructions for the LLM to analyze slices for external service dependencies and write the secrets manifest.
- Why it matters: Without prompt instructions, the LLM won't know to forecast secrets.
- Source: user
- Primary owning slice: M001/S01
- Supporting slices: none
- Validation: plan-milestone.md has Secret Forecasting section at line 62 with instructions to write {{secretsOutputPath}} with H3 sections per key.
- Notes: Implemented in plan-milestone.md.

### R010 — secure_env_collect enhanced with guidance display
- Class: primary-user-loop
- Status: validated
- Description: The secure_env_collect TUI renders multi-line guidance steps above the masked input field on the same page, so the user sees setup instructions while entering the key.
- Why it matters: Without visible guidance, the user has to find keys on their own despite the LLM having generated instructions.
- Source: user
- Primary owning slice: M001/S02
- Supporting slices: none
- Validation: collectOneSecret accepts guidance parameter, renders numbered dim-styled lines with wrapTextWithAnsi above masked input (collect-from-manifest.test.ts tests 6-8).
- Notes: The guidance field is rendered in collectOneSecret().

### R015 — Module decomposition of browser-tools
- Class: quality-attribute
- Status: validated
- Description: The monolithic browser-tools index.ts (~5000 lines) is split into focused modules: shared infrastructure, tool groups, and browser-side utilities. All 43 existing tools continue to work identically.
- Why it matters: A 5000-line file is unmaintainable and makes targeted changes risky. Module boundaries enable safe refactoring and new tool development.
- Source: user
- Primary owning slice: M002/S01
- Supporting slices: none
- Validation: Extension loads via jiti, 43 tools register, browser navigate/snapshot/click work against real page, index.ts is 47-line orchestrator with zero registerTool calls, 9 tool files under tools/.
- Notes: core.js already exists with ~1000 lines of shared utilities. The split extends this pattern.

### R016 — Shared browser-side evaluate utilities
- Class: quality-attribute
- Status: validated
- Description: Common functions duplicated across page.evaluate boundaries (cssPath, simpleHash, isVisible, isEnabled, inferRole, accessibleName) are injected once and referenced from all evaluate callbacks.
- Why it matters: Currently buildRefSnapshot and resolveRefTarget each redeclare ~100 lines of identical utility code. Deduplication reduces payload size, improves maintainability, and ensures consistency.
- Source: user
- Primary owning slice: M002/S01
- Supporting slices: none
- Validation: window.__pi contains all 9 functions, survives navigation, refs.ts has zero inline redeclarations, close/reopen re-injects via addInitScript correctly.
- Notes: Uses context.addInitScript under window.__pi namespace.

### R017 — Consolidated state capture per action
- Class: core-capability
- Status: validated
- Description: The before-state capture, after-state capture, post-action summary, and recent-error check are consolidated into fewer page.evaluate calls per action.
- Why it matters: Every action tool currently runs 3-4 separate page.evaluate calls for state capture. Consolidating them reduces latency on every single browser interaction.
- Source: user
- Primary owning slice: M002/S02
- Supporting slices: M002/S01
- Validation: postActionSummary eliminated from action tools, countOpenDialogs removed from ToolDeps, consolidated capture pattern. Build passes.
- Notes: captureCompactPageState and postActionSummary merged into single evaluate.

### R018 — Conditional body text capture
- Class: core-capability
- Status: validated
- Description: Body text capture (includeBodyText: true) is skipped for low-signal actions (scroll, hover, Tab key press) and enabled for high-signal actions (navigate, click, type, submit).
- Why it matters: Capturing 4000 chars of body text on every scroll or hover is wasteful. Conditional capture reduces evaluate overhead.
- Source: user
- Primary owning slice: M002/S02
- Supporting slices: none
- Validation: explicit includeBodyText true/false per tool signal level in interaction.ts. Classification codified in D017. Build passes.
- Notes: Requires classifying each tool as high-signal or low-signal.

### R019 — Faster settle on zero mutations
- Class: core-capability
- Status: validated
- Description: settleAfterActionAdaptive short-circuits with a smaller quiet window when no mutation observer fires in the first 60ms.
- Why it matters: Many SPA interactions produce no DOM changes. Short-circuiting saves time on the most common case.
- Source: user
- Primary owning slice: M002/S02
- Supporting slices: none
- Validation: zero_mutation_shortcut settle reason in state.ts type union and settle.ts return path. 60ms/30ms thresholds codified in D019. Build passes.
- Notes: Track whether any mutation fired at all; if zero after 60ms, use a shorter quiet window.

### R020 — Sharp-based screenshot resizing
- Class: core-capability
- Status: validated
- Description: constrainScreenshot uses the sharp Node library for image resizing instead of bouncing buffers through page canvas context.
- Why it matters: Faster, no page dependency for image processing.
- Source: user
- Primary owning slice: M002/S03
- Supporting slices: M002/S01
- Validation: constrainScreenshot uses sharp(buffer).metadata() and sharp(buffer).resize(). Zero page.evaluate calls in capture.ts. Build passes.
- Notes: sharp added as a dependency.

### R021 — Opt-in screenshots on navigate
- Class: core-capability
- Status: validated
- Description: browser_navigate does not capture or return a screenshot by default. An explicit parameter opts in to screenshot capture.
- Why it matters: Significant token savings — the screenshot payload is large and often unnecessary.
- Source: user
- Primary owning slice: M002/S03
- Supporting slices: none
- Validation: browser_navigate has screenshot parameter default false. Capture gated. Build passes.
- Notes: Default is off. The agent can still use browser_screenshot explicitly.

### R022 — Form analysis tool (browser_analyze_form)
- Class: core-capability
- Status: validated
- Description: A browser_analyze_form tool that returns field inventory including labels, names, types, required status, current values, validation state, and submit controls.
- Why it matters: Collapses 3-8 tool calls for form analysis into one.
- Source: user
- Primary owning slice: M002/S04
- Supporting slices: M002/S01
- Validation: 7-level label resolution, form auto-detection, fieldset grouping, submit button discovery. Verified end-to-end against 12-field test form. Build passes.
- Notes: Must handle label association via for/id, wrapping label, aria-label, aria-labelledby, and placeholder.

### R023 — Form fill tool (browser_fill_form)
- Class: core-capability
- Status: validated
- Description: A browser_fill_form tool that maps labels/names/placeholders to inputs and fills them with type-aware Playwright APIs.
- Why it matters: Collapses 3-5 tool calls for form filling into one.
- Source: user
- Primary owning slice: M002/S04
- Supporting slices: M002/S01
- Validation: 5-strategy field resolution, type-aware fill via Playwright APIs, verified end-to-end with 10 fields. Build passes.
- Notes: Returns matched fields, unmatched values, fields skipped, and validation state.

### R024 — Intent-ranked element retrieval (browser_find_best)
- Class: core-capability
- Status: validated
- Description: A browser_find_best tool that returns scored candidates using deterministic heuristic ranking for 8 semantic intents.
- Why it matters: Cuts a round trip and reduces reasoning tokens for common element-finding tasks.
- Source: user
- Primary owning slice: M002/S05
- Supporting slices: M002/S01
- Validation: 8 intents implemented with 4-dimension scoring. Verified via Playwright tests. Build passes, tool count = 47.
- Notes: Deterministic heuristics only. No hidden LLM calls.

### R025 — Semantic action tool (browser_act)
- Class: core-capability
- Status: validated
- Description: A browser_act tool that resolves the top candidate for a semantic intent and executes the action in one call.
- Why it matters: Collapses 2-4 tool calls for common micro-tasks into one.
- Source: user
- Primary owning slice: M002/S05
- Supporting slices: M002/S04
- Validation: Resolves via same scoring engine as browser_find_best. Executes via Playwright locator. Returns before/after diff. Build passes, tool count = 47.
- Notes: Builds on browser_find_best for element selection. Bounded — does not loop or retry.

### R026 — Test coverage for new and refactored code
- Class: quality-attribute
- Status: validated
- Description: Test suite covers shared browser-side utilities, settle logic, screenshot resizing, form tools, and intent ranking.
- Why it matters: Regression protection for refactored and new features.
- Source: user
- Primary owning slice: M002/S06
- Supporting slices: all M002 slices
- Validation: 108 tests (63 unit + 45 integration) passing via `npm run test:browser-tools`.
- Notes: Test what's unit-testable without a browser. Integration tests with Playwright for tools that need a page.

## Deferred

### R011 — Multi-milestone secret forecasting
- Class: core-capability
- Status: deferred
- Description: Forecast secrets across all planned milestones, not just the active one.
- Why it matters: Would provide a complete picture of all secrets needed for the project.
- Source: user
- Primary owning slice: none
- Supporting slices: none
- Validation: unmapped
- Notes: Deferred — single-milestone forecasting is sufficient for now.

### R012 — Secret rotation reminders
- Class: operability
- Status: deferred
- Description: Track secret age and remind users when keys may need rotation.
- Why it matters: Security best practice, but not essential for the core workflow.
- Source: user
- Primary owning slice: none
- Supporting slices: none
- Validation: unmapped
- Notes: Deferred — out of scope for initial release.

### R027 — Browser reuse across sessions
- Class: core-capability
- Status: deferred
- Description: Keep a warm browser instance across rapid successive agent contexts to avoid ~2-3s Chrome cold-start per session.
- Why it matters: Would eliminate Chrome launch latency in auto-mode.
- Source: user
- Primary owning slice: none
- Supporting slices: none
- Validation: unmapped
- Notes: Deferred — skip completely per user direction.

### R042 — Parallel milestone execution in multiple worktrees
- Class: core-capability
- Status: deferred
- Description: Run multiple milestones simultaneously in separate worktrees with independent auto-mode sessions.
- Why it matters: Natural extension of worktree-per-milestone architecture. Would enable parallel work streams.
- Source: user
- Primary owning slice: none
- Supporting slices: none
- Validation: unmapped
- Notes: Deferred — ship sequential milestone execution first. The worktree infrastructure naturally supports this later.

### R043 — Native libgit2 write operations
- Class: quality-attribute
- Status: deferred
- Description: Extend the Rust/libgit2 native module to cover write operations (commit, merge, checkout) in addition to the current read-only queries.
- Why it matters: Would eliminate execSync overhead for git writes on the hot path.
- Source: inferred
- Primary owning slice: none
- Supporting slices: none
- Validation: unmapped
- Notes: Deferred — execSync writes are functional. Optimize later if profiling shows it matters.

## Out of Scope

### R013 — Curated service knowledge base
- Class: anti-feature
- Status: out-of-scope
- Description: A static database of known services with pre-written guidance for each API key.
- Why it matters: Prevents scope creep. LLM-generated guidance is sufficient and stays current without maintenance.
- Source: user
- Primary owning slice: none
- Supporting slices: none
- Validation: n/a
- Notes: LLM generates guidance dynamically.

### R014 — Just-in-time collection enhancement
- Class: anti-feature
- Status: out-of-scope
- Description: Detect missing secrets during task execution and collect them inline.
- Why it matters: Prevents scope confusion. M001 is about proactive collection, not reactive.
- Source: user
- Primary owning slice: none
- Supporting slices: none
- Validation: n/a
- Notes: Existing secure_env_collect already handles reactive collection.

### R028 — LLM-powered intent resolution
- Class: anti-feature
- Status: out-of-scope
- Description: Using hidden LLM calls inside browser_find_best or browser_act for intent resolution.
- Why it matters: Prevents unpredictable latency and cost.
- Source: inferred
- Primary owning slice: none
- Supporting slices: none
- Validation: n/a
- Notes: browser_find_best and browser_act use scoring heuristics, not LLM inference.

### R044 — Rebase merge strategy
- Class: anti-feature
- Status: out-of-scope
- Description: Adding rebase as a merge strategy option alongside squash and --no-ff merge.
- Why it matters: Rebase rewrites history, which conflicts with the "commit diary" philosophy. It also introduces more failure modes (rebase conflicts are harder to auto-resolve than merge conflicts).
- Source: inferred
- Primary owning slice: none
- Supporting slices: none
- Validation: n/a
- Notes: --no-ff merge + squash covers all needed use cases without history rewriting.
